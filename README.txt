Homework 1 - Craft a Scene


The scene displayed in this Unity game is a 3D rendering of the interior
view of a bedroom, with defining furniture and other details, created through
the usage of imported objects and materials. Some of these objects include a
bed, desk and chair, shelves, a floor and walls, as well as other objects to
give the scene some extra detail. The majority of these objects were obtained
from the Unity Asset Store. There was no particular source that inspired
me to create this scene, rather I had primarily just wanted to create a
scene you may find in real life, and design the interior of a potential
bedroom using the unity game engine. The main character used in this scene for
the first and third person camera view is the model of an orange cat standing 
on top of the bed object in the scene.
